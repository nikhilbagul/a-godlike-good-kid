# a-godlike-good-kid

A Godlike Good Kid is an interactive comic book experience that will take you on a journey through an enigmatic, magical world. As a “God” of this world, help Faye through her misadventures and unravel the mystery of the lost memories. Imagine Telltale-like storytelling, where the player’s point of view is beyond the fourth wall, and your actions change the world.
